# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing respect and appreciation for others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information without permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

2. **Warning** – Official warning for continued inappropriate behavior.
